# Michael Nall's GitHub Profile

Welcome to my public profile! 

I am currently working on the [Learn Enough](https://www.learnenough.com/) sequence of courses to become a Web Developer. I have completed the Developer Fundamentals sequence, and I am now in the middle of the Web Basics sequence.

Below is a [Certficate of Completion](https://www.learnenough.com/certificates/miken) from [Learn Enough](https://www.learnenough.com/). It works like this:

<a href="https://www.learnenough.com/certificates/miken"><img src="https://www.learnenough.com/certificates/miken/html-tutorial.svg" alt="Certificate of Completion for Learn Enough HTML"></a>

That badge shows I have completed the online courses for [Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/html).

The courses in the Developer Fundamentals sequence by Michael Hartl and [Learn Enough](https://www.learnenough.com/) that I have completed include [Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line), [Learn Enough Text Editor to Be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/text-editor), and [Learn Enough Git to Be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/git). However, I purchased these courses before [Learn Enough](https://www.learnenough.com/) began offering badges.
